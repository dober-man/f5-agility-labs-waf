Module 1: ASM Policy Template Creation on BIG-IP
===================================================
Expected time to complete: **1 hours**


For this module weâ€™re going to be using a combination of the F5 TMUI (GUI) and Postman to make API calls to the F5 via AS3.  
AS3 stands for Application Services 3 Extension.  AS3 is a flexible, low-overhead mechanism for managing application-specific configurations on a BIG-IP system. 
AS3 uses a declarative model, meaning you provide a JSON declaration rather than a set of imperative commands. 
The declaration represents the configuration which AS3 is responsible for creating on a BIG-IP system.  To learn more about AS3, you can visit:
