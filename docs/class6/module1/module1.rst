Module 1: ASM Policy Template Creation on BIG-IP (secops engineer) 
===================================================

**Intro**

As the security engineer, you are tasked with building a WAF policy template that will be used by the application teams. 

Since the policy is used by multipile teams, it will mostly contain nagative security controls (signatures, ip reputation...) 

during the excersise, think which settings should be enables and how changes to the template will be managed. 

also think about how you can test your policy. since it's not going to be deployed by the security engineer. 

**In this lab, we will cover the following:**

- Creation of an AWAF base policy (lab1) 
- Creating a template from a base policy (lab2)
- Deploying to a 'secops testing' environemnt (lab3)
